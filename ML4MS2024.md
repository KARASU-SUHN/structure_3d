Accelerating materials design with AI emulators and generators
===========================================================


### Materials design is the cornerstone of modern technology


a lot of things that we are facing today a lot of challenges our society facing today they are really bottleneck by finding a new material for example if we can find a better battery material is much higher energy density so this can be part of the Next Generation Battery Technology important for things like electric cars or large-scale energy storage at a grade level, the same goals into many other domains. Carbon Capture and quantum computer, each one of them could potentially led into a lot of benefit.

### Central question of materials design

Find materials whose properties satisfying the design requirements for the target application

Prof.shyue listed some of the design requirement that was needed for finding a good solid state electrolyte material for the lithium batteries 




### Simulators, AI emulators, and generators

Materials design via screening 

one very popular approach that has been a major impact in the past decade is to discover new material with this large scale computational screening methods. 
Start with a 10K or 100K materials you run this computational workflows to gradually filter down the candidates via screening funnels and at the end you have maybe 5 to 10 materials that are most promising which you send into experimental lab to synthesiz and measure their properties and then if you find that maybe one or two material that is really good. see the battery material right then you try to scale that up and the building to real batteries that lead into commercialization of this new materials. 


Major progress in past few years: using AI to accelerate this process

active learning strategy 


They developed the active learning strategy to iteratively discover more materials using by training a machine learning force field combined with substitution method, they were able to discover 2.2 million novel and stable materials and among which 400,000 of them on a convex hull. 


they expands the initial candidate space by one other magnitude from 10^5 to 10^6 for many of the application.



####  Accelerate the simulation by 1000x

In addition, another important research is to accelerate this the simulator for the screening process where we have seen this General force field so similar to like MCGnet which have enabled 1,000 times faster simulation for a lot of the simulation workflows.

Next frontier: generative materials design


### Learning a generative model for materials

learning objective:
- Generate all metastable materials that forms periodic structure in 3D

Desiderate:
- Equivariant generation process that respects the symmetry of materials
- Captures periodicity
- Ability to add different conditions



**thermal properity in final filtering stage**
generate 10 materials then run simulation to identify their thero stability and a filter out those candidates that were not stable









### Simulators, AI emulators, and generators

it has been really successful in the past decade is to use high super screening here you use conventional simulators like that's the functional Theory to compute the range of a properties that you're interested in or running xx dynamics to simulate, like conductivity.


Traditional way:  Conventional simulator ("forward problem")

key question: how you can use AI to disturb the traditional process for material discovering.
