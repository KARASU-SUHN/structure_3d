so the last the last speaker of the of this event will unfortunately be online we did try very very hard to bring everybody to Joanna but in this particular case they didn't work the CF from Microsoft research will will give a talk about some of their really exciting Recent research on using 3D Transformers please bear a few minutes until we do all of the switching necessary but don't leave the lecture room just yet because there is this great talk coming up welcome is great to have you read us if anyone online only and let's see can we can we hear you can you say something thank you great to see everybody I'm really sorry I couldn't join but really great to meeting everybody I am listening to some great talks I look forward to chatting with discussing with you okay yeah thanks thanks again like for for the invitation a really great to be here to to share something about some of the airport at Microsoft Office so yeah so to give you so I'm part of the Microsoft research Global team working across several different locations but then I'll go I'll go is trying to use AI to accelerometers design so to give you a bit of overview about Air Force size at Microsoft so Microsoft Office we are a new organization located globally across several different locations and we are really introducing team trying to bring people together for machine learning a combination of chemistry and software to solve some of the biggest challenge so yeah I said that we are located in many different parts of the world so in Europe we are have a locations in Amsterdam in Berlin and also in Cambridge in the UK and so we have a lot of people in China or in Beijing and Shanghai and we have a relatively small team in Redmond in the USA so I'm personally right now based in Cambridge in the UK so it's also the goal here as I mentioned here right is that we really wanted to bring people together for multiple domains to pursue some of the larger and highly ambitious projects and so so so so so so so so so so so 


that we hope to be looking for some lunch time and also a lot of innovation what is the one of the corner stores in modern technology 

write a lot of things that we are facing today a lot of challenges our society facing today they are both connected by finding a new material for example if we can find a better battery material right so this can be part of the Next Generation Battery Technology important for things like electric cars or large-scale energy storage 450 electrical material for the Disneyland batteries 


so traditionally what people have been one of this community has been doing I think it has been really successful in the past decade is to use High super screening here you use conventional simulators like that's the functional Theory right to compute the range of a properties that you're interested in or running backs by 2 2 2. 0 0 5 


did your status that generated by this traditional similarity to train a air emulator like machine learning force fields because because the Ft you can you can you it's like solving showing the equation right so you can generate a lot of data from using physical laws but this data can be used to train a machine learning model to achieve the same results faster so the second area where I can start over to directly generate materials design you can no longer need to screen on this phone you can direct you what are you looking for and accessing a much bigger hypothetical space materials so this true problems the are emulator problem and also generate a air problem are the two things that we have been working on at the materials team at Microsoft research airport size so last year we we we we we we we we we we released 4023 competition so this is the last hour I'm going to I'll give you a brief overview about both of these two models and hoping to give you a sense about how we are trying to disrupt material Discovery with AI here so let me first to get started with the medicine because I think it's even though it's a it's a later model that we release them it's kind of a let's start with the phone and then go back to song so I think a lot of the excitement right around the building a machine at and I think this is the first time people show that you can actually train a machine and surprisingly it gives quite a good performance or a broader range of different tasks like Discovery Nova crystals right or or predicting the phone numbers of some new materials and many many more I think in a way this paper is a spot a lot of excitement around this idea of 208 Universal machine being able to expand the number of the noble materials by 10 times 2 million which is a significant and this meeting and this is really into this genome data said I was just showing this model and another reason that the most is this paper I charge that from a professor Garcia's group right where they also they use the same data set the format is project but they were able to instead of only predictive movement which demonstrates that is another reason a book here right song is tomorrow to broad range of problems including including like including like a interfaces or even Solider basically they try that I think a 30 different problems with his first Fields the skin people assess about some kind of a Sparks about the foundation model right that you have a model that really works for broad range apartment so this create a lot of excitement in this area but I think that we think that will really missing from a lot of early works right is that is a problem that most people have been training on is this is from relaxation do you have a lot of a force and energy that are closer to the equilibrium 




but you're not really liking configurations that are really far away from me quickly but so when we try to visualize that is to looking at the space of above the stress and the temperature we're here we visualizing the the configurations in ipf data set on their distribution in terms of the effective temperature so you can see that this is a really narrow is centered around the area where you're kind of a closer to equilibrium in simulating because that requires so therefore in this work in Madison Wisconsin temperature and pressure I got it about the fact that we want to cover from 0k to 500 K and from new car parts to 18 GBA which covers the majority of the new case of how people want to use mamma first field and there's hope and this created a model that way go to find handling the majority conditions for emulating so what we did in this work is trying to use on search engine to guide the exploration of new configurations so the highest number you take this this like one existing machine anymore certainty and then we have a so-called off equilibrium Explorer meaning which is basically running backs by taking a lot of configurations but we don't want like the Ft on all this snapshots we use this uncertainty qualifier to only looking for this this configurations that have high uncertainty given the coronavirus and we use this as a future application so that we only do a small amount of the really sets so we do this for multiple times and this is including 777 177 in the MP have a data set as a result so your medicine was able to achieve a greater performance in a broad range of tasks including a false prediction including a novel material Discovery right and also including predictive to do a lot of things so I'm going to give you a few examples so here the first example is to do go to Discovery we combine this force field with the random structure search Master to 32 enumerate all the possible binary compounds that was coming from all the possible combinations of elements are in the periodic table so this is a really really really really really really expensive to do if you want to do with traditional RSS because even for like one combination you needed to run and maybe half a million you once you are for a new chemical chemical space that it has less data on right you can we can do this Active Learning Loop where you only need a small amount of a new data to find you the space model instead of a training from scratch as you can see this figure which show that you can save 90% of the data compared with compared with Facebook and you can also be fine with with Siri so for example how many people know that you order to a model is usually very very expensive but by finding instead of a training directly from scratch we 634 the data reduction to which stewardship the same agency by directly training from high accuracy data from scratch okay so this is kind of the Brave overview about the magazine that you can search for the paper for more details to give you a summary so this is a okay so now let's move on to the next section right so I have mentioned that thing which really enabled us to simulate another materials pretty much faster to screen your materials right but this this really enable us to screen a lot of materials I want to see in order to another 5 to 10 to the other six but even but even with that this is a stew and Tiny portion of the potential space anymore right so you need to do different you need to have a journey tomorrow so this is why we developed a message which allows to access this larger material Space by directions to structures Guided by the Target properties that you are interested in and so this is the so so he messaged him what we did is that we have a developed the diffusion model that is specifically for crystals so I'm not sure how this audience are familiar with diffusion model but this is a state of Arkansas this means that you need to design a special if you can process for this materials so in this world we we we we design this special corruption process for crystals to craft it and then reverse model continuously model that generates from the noisy data okay so in the next few steps I'm going to give you a little bit more detail to talk about how do we design the folder production process to give you a sense about how we did it so the key aspect here is that you will want something special which defines how they system repeat and so we in order to design this for fraction process what we did is that we first the factorize this for the corruption process into three independent process first doing atom time diffusion seconds to inflation of quantity diffusion and it's not the one is to do letters diffusion so that in a for the question process we had a noise individually to each one of these atoms so for the corruption process of adding types right we take an approach called the DCPS which is designed for categorical variables so that the big idea is that we need some kind of a transition Matrix to Define how you can move from a different type to another and so we end up trying different options but this one is the best which is called a master diffusion diffusion process which you you have certain probability for each item to translate and so once you are at the bastard State you never go back so therefore in a full process every every atom becomes this mustang and in Reverse process you start with this great atom and move back to the real at times so to handle a rational coordinates we the one important stuff so we learned from this paper called the total diffusion which they have the same problem but think about that a potion of angle right inside its angle between -5 and Pi but also if you go outside of a pie right so go back for so therefore they showed that you can actually kind of periodic objects using something called a normal distribution basically the sum of gaussian distribution over some other gaussian distribution but each centered around the 02 Pi minus 2/4 + you can see this scholarship becoming a broader than a brother and a limiting distribution you are uniform distribution so therefore we just extend this into 3D right so that the limit so this is the square by 327 because this is kind of virus in the kitchen space so the last thing we did is that this lattice diffusion where we try to Define diffusion processes for this one out of three branches so I'm thinking we we need to do is to do so called a polar decomposition because the point is that in here if you rotate this L1 L2 L3 right so this entire Crystal doesn't change so you want to get rid of this rotational degree for them so by doing a political position we can decompose any Matrix into a rotational I wish I'm not going to get yesterday but if you want to know more you can also read that paper so once so here is kind of about the overview about our model right so in the process we crossed the model and then we train agenda tomorrow to reverse the corruption process to generate in the crystal so in order to train this material you need to have a lot of materials judges from three different sources one is all the collection of normal we take all this and we did some filter ability to see that into 600,300 which is 15 times bigger than the most popular data set people no money train is models and so we and we use this trailer model which give you credit performance but in order to evaluate this for performance right we need to have some quantitative Magics which is usually not easy thing especially for tomorrow to a combination called a stable unique mobile so you can see that our model at the gym significant performance previously what city and the improvements both coming from model and data by improving a model we achieving 1.5 times better performance well by screen of a data which is 1.8 times better performance and another important magic is how close the structure jobs and at the end the average Army 0.02 extra which is a very small number so we are also calling impressed by this house so so now I'm talking about the space model right we have a train our base model that can generate materials across how you can generate materials giving the desired properties that you're looking for right so in order to do that we adopt a porch comma fine tuning so the big idea is that we take the space model and we add this additional conditioning as an MLP which which changes output of this baseball thing like a little bit more later in the next few slides so the first is how you can generate material give me a specific chemistry so here we are trying to generate a novel materials in the astronomia and oxygen chemical system so you can see all the green dots are the ones that generated compared with some of the other Stranded by our business so you have the key Point here I want to make it January with others in a broad range of this problems and I gave you a little bit more statistics to give you a sense for example the number of State University Systems and also in for the structure close to the colors now we are kind of similar to substitution with similar to what kind of close to substitution in in four elements system where much better than anybody else in five minutes so I think this shows that the voltage is because five elements system is a very big kind of small space right so this is where you can shut your materials the second thing I can do is we need to generate the material properties which is the mechanical properties so when he started that I want to highlight here is that we really sure that the model can shift the distribution of the generator the property management right so in here 1.7 this is a very significant because a lot of material design problems that goes trying to find the materials with extreme party right like super hard materials or strong magnets right but this is a this is where I think this journey tomorrow can really show a lot about the advantage so here's another example to show that to show up as we increase the amount of it while the screening message okay so that's kind of a brief overview About Management I guess I think I want to interact with if you want to know more details feel free to read our paper but the Highlight is that this is the state of Virginia tomorrow that really enables the broad range of publicity design so to get to to kind of a combine all this together and they give a little bit of Outlook into the future right so what am I trying to do here at Microsoft research is really trying to bring this are emulators and generates together and who was the real world impact right you can we we hope to use this medicine to simulate the broad range of parties that people interested in and then use better to buy the novel material discoveries so next is clearly trying to demonstrate so this is something that we are working towards and I believe that we are at the moment where this AI based models can can can can can can can can can can can disrupt some of the traditional material Discovery process so this is the end of the top and thanks for you listening and happy to take any questions thank you oh sorry I want to just the highlights this final slide which is that this work is not possible Right with all the team members we have here so we have the the medicine team thank you very much thank you very much and we do have a couple of questions please use the mic always because he won't be able to hear you thank you very much for this great talk I have two questions actually related for this so when you have there you have the slide with this condition extra condition see to define a property so when you get to the to the to the structure is this one structure you get the mean many structures distribution of structures and then another question is so if you have many of these desired properties and a school that relates to the scarcity of elements so this is something that we can already do so therefore you can you can take you can take a training data with the structure and many properties right and then you can also use this to train your model thank you thanks again for a great talk now that we're on the topic I want to mention a property of stability so obviously your generating a lot of fantastic structures which have lots of functional properties but they have to be stable and we have to have a synthesis route and let's just start with stability so how do you how do you see going forward integrating this into the models here but let me just give a brief one right so one thing so I think currently we invited us which evaluates the 0k stability of the Crystal this is a an approximation in a sense that people mostly cares about the most ability because a lot of materials they are the things that are just heating them at the super high temperature but this is the very rough approximation right so therefore there are a lot more ways we can do this for example you can estimate the phone number of materials and there is a lot of their relationship between so so kindly we are solving this problem mostly by filtering meaning I generate 100 Candice and we have additional filter to say OK Google but I think in the future we might also including more this into improving our training data set so that the model can directly generate more sensible candidates but this is a very interesting area that I think a lot of people are discussing right now in the community so so yeah we're looking forward to like a really really with the company how about this order because yesterday we had from the representative from Google that they're not leaving 600,002 million is really struggling to deal with Disorder so real world applications I guess they include desert crystals glassy materials for structures where do we go so for example you can estimate based on the size of your house if you are in if you are in organic material space right but but that's even better right so currently we just have additional workflows to filter the candidates but yeah but in the future we might directly type call this with alternative model so that we can directly generate this order in the materials directly generate more information thank you so much thank you so much
