all right so given that we have looks like we already have a decent crowd and it sounded like we need every minute we have let's let's get started right on time so we'll come everyone to this latest installment of the MP seminar series my name is yanosh and I'm your host for today seminar for anyone who's new to this series hold on a couple questions coming up here sorry for anyone new to this series we welcome presentations from both eminent researchers and early career scientists and if you know someone you would like to nominate as a future speaker that can be yourself as well you can visit materials project.org seminars where we have a speaker suggestion for him we will be recording this talk and it will be posted to the MP YouTube channel in the next couple of days if you have questions please just raise your hand during the talk Toolbar to submit them and then we will definitely also have a question and answer session at the very end already mentioned that it will be an in-depth presentation so it's best if you brought a few extra minutes for questions at the end it's quite possible that will run a few minutes over and so with that said let me go straight to introducing today's speaker today we have the Microsoft AI for science team working on generative modeling of inorganic materials which I believe is spread across Microsoft's Cambridge UK and and Redmond us offices before joining Microsoft in 2022 Jen was a talk at MIT and before that he did a PhD in Material Science and Engineering also at MIT advice by Jeffrey Grossman and in this seminar at 10 will present his most recent paper which introduces a new generative model for arbitrary periodic materials called matter Jen and in this paper they demonstrate that matter in both increases the success rate of proposing new stable crystals while also being able to hear more closely to user-defined property constraints and these can differ wildly from the from the modes of those properties in the models training data which is a very compelling feature and which I'm sure we'll have more about in this talk so with that let me stop sharing my screen and and the stage over to John please take it away thank you very much first for your invitation and also for like waiting to so I wouldn't have to maybe make a little complication first thing that I'm needing the materials team at the airport size so I'm not leaving the entire are for South Africa of course so and also we have actually so we are pretty Global team we have teams in the UK Cambridge Amsterdam Netherlands Berlin in Germany and also Beijing and Shanghai in China and Redmond Washington what is amateur 79 serious so most of the things I'm going to talk about the day will be available you can see that in more detail in this pre-print that we have posted around a month ago okay so now let me get started so so first so I wanted to highlight the manager is really the result of the highly clever teamwork that we have at a for signs the core team are the seven people that was listed at the top top and also we have a major like a lot of contributions from of our interests and many other researchers at Air Force size so I was just want to say this is really not possible without the contribution of everybody and it's such a good pressure to work with all of them are in the past year so for this audience probably I don't need to explain why materials are important they are really the Cornerstone of modern technology and many of the problems we're facing today they're really important right by finding new materials for example if we can find a better material is much higher than its density the electric cars could be running much longer if we can find the one carbon capture material that can absorb carbon CO2 very well it could become a key component of this carbon capture industry that many expected to be on the older than a trillion dollar Revenue in the coming decade so as the central question right images for the application so you hearing one slide from Professor shooting on where he listed some of the design requirements I was needed right for finding a good estate so in general speaking right we have combination workflows for each one of these design requirements where the key challenge is ready to find a material whose property satisfy all this property constraints so one more very popular approach that has been a Major Impact in the past decade is to discover new material with this large scale computational screening methods so so you start with a 10K or 100K materials you run this computational workflows right to gradually filter down a candidates the screening funnels and at the end you have maybe 10 5 to 10 at the most promising which you stand into experiment a lot to see the size of the puppies and then if you find that maybe one or two material that is really good the battery material right then you try to steal that up and the building to real real bad ways that leading to a commercialization listening to so in the past few years we have seen major progress in using AI to accelerate this process so I think many of you have heard about this genome work for Google do you mind where they developed the active learning strategy to iteratively discover more materials using by training a machine with a combined with substitution method where they were able to discover 2.2 million novel and stable materials and among which of 4,400,000 on a compass house so this what is this is a really expensive the initial candidate space right by one of the phone number six for many of the applications so in addition another important research is really to use to use a accelerate this the simulator for the screening process where we have seen this General force field right so similar to like MCG not which have enabled 1,000 * 52 for a lot of the simulation of those so here's the one reason I wanted is coming from our colleagues and Microsoft Azure Quantum team where they use and mcgillen a lot of material and they were all the way to the lab and find this one material that have that have a 70% now no more experimentally discovered for collaboration with piano in the lab so so with all these major advances right so in in Computing Discovery we think it's pretty clear that one with the next Frontier is really generated best material design so we're with the state of art write screening best message and we now can access in order for 10 to the other 5 to 10 / 6 or the materials right but if you really want to access this much larger space of potential materials so you have to use genitals so this enables us to break through this another 526 of a larger space so this is why we developed the manager which is the one of the first design which I'm going to explain in more detail for the rest of my truck so the alarm for this talk is going to be following so because I know maybe some of the audience maybe are coming from like a machine learning domain so I'm going to start by talking about what are materials and then I'm going I'm going to details regarding the our diffusion model for materials and then I'm going to talk about how your train is model and the generator no more stable materials then I'm going to talk about the conditional generation finally I'm going to talk about how you can apply this model to some more realistic images design problems okay so now let's get it started so in here when we talked about the material about a specific type of material called Crystal name materials so so so so so so here I'm sure you're outside which is basically a material the discovery of which one in the world price because it's such an important component but there is a real form it can look like as a powder or like a crystal but in atomic scale it is a periodic arrangement of atoms in the 3D dimensional space I wanted to kind of highlights that so in here this atom can be made up with all the elements in the periodic table this is a core different from other Atomic systems like small molecules or proteins where most elements are coming from the carbohydrates and oxygen so mathematically in order to describe material you need a usually to represent them using it's smaller than repeating unit which we call unisa because it is a periodic structure right so the fully describe this mathematically you need to describe the atom types and coordinates and atoms and also you need to describe a lettuce which is a list of three factors which describes the periodicity of the system of three dimensions in the in the in the city dimensional space so you can imagine that you can kind of take according to all the integer combinations of this LOL to see vectors and then you can tell the entire city dimensional space to form the periodic structure so I just want to know here that here we represent the atom coordinates with a fractional coordinate which is a number between 0 and 1 and using this L1 L2 L3 as the basis and so if you want to convert that into the conditions then you need to do a a matrix multiplication to this album here so in after I have described the definition of material it is important to understand what would mean by the stability of the materials right so so basically in here so you can imagine assuming that you have two elements and according to the previous mathematical definition so you can kind of arrange these two items in infinite different ways right to form a period of the structure and obviously not all of them are stable right so each one of them will have its energy so therefore but so if you notice the energy that we can help you to understand which ones are stable using this so-called composition of face diagram here I'm floating all the all the materials for A&B in this X Y Cloud where the x-axis is the the original a a and b and y-axis is their formation energy so you can it is know that the materials are stable even if they are on the lowest cost of this plot basically the Green Dots here and the basically all the points all the structures that are about this house like the Bluetooth here they were decomposed into material that is on the on the Commerce house so play Space security gives you a sense why which how do you know if a material is stable and is also important to introduce this concept of energy of the house which is basically the distance of the material for his energy with respect to the Commerce how so generally speaking we think a material is stable if they are exactly on how but they can also be manageable if they are within the 0.15 so they can still have the chance to be synthesized for example diamond is one example that is around 1:40 about the colors so after learning the definition of the material as well as the definition of stability it is we can actually formulate the learning objective right of our generator so he can hear our goal is to be able to learn English model that was able to generate all possible a metastable materials that can form add periodic structure in the three dimensional space so in here we Define as stable as a mean within 0.1 evap obviously this can be defined a better but this is what we do within the scope of this work so and so because actually in here we are building a genetic model material right but we are actually so we're actually rest in the regime of low energy model space so it's very important that we can build in a inductive buys right into the model for example we hope that the generation process can be symmetry can respect that the equivalent equivalent of the materials we have to capture symmetry will help to be able to add different conditions and they are some of the constraints of Hope into building into a model so now I'm going to the next section maybe I'm seeing you a few a few questions are coming in the store that I want to maybe if people can shut out for maybe one quick question if they want to ask now maybe it's a good time otherwise I'll just move on yeah oh there's actually a question from let me see if I can unmute that person I think you're unmuted to know that how you extend the your search engine have a lot of that have very similar energy right that is kind of also a close to the comments are right now we just put all different configurations of alloy into our training data but basically but we are the Trinity is certainly not exhaustive for all different configurations so therefore this is actually one of our future step we hope to make the model work better for us for the first judges that we have in our training data and use it tomorrow morning use models to generate the models of actually possible configurations only using using Android structures that were very popular search it's only what we have in a 2008 and the last question is how you will bring a thermal stability to the to the play because I think for this slides you just focused on actually grounded structures and I didn't see any temperature dependency in your slots yes we don't have any temperature in stage so the the only considers the okay but we can incorporate for example simulation to identify yourself candidates that are not stable yeah all right thanks for answering that I think we can move on okay yeah let's move on because I think we have a limited amount of time so sorry what's the regarding our diffusion model so I think for those of you who are not familiar with diffusion of those diffusion model is one of the one of the latest in the state of art class of genetic model for that was developing machine learning so instead of other generation performance for images proteins Etc so I'm not going to get here today but if you want to learn more about the future models and give you some links about some really nice tutorials for diffusion models so at a higher level right so the diffusion model in diffusion models you kind of for the data modeling you have you kind of a design a fixed corruption for the corruption process in which you you graduate and noises like calcium noise in English and then you gradually image some kind of a limiting distribution which is fixed that you can sample from at the same time you would have learned a reverse which is a which is a more than most of the time and your network to kind of reverse this corruption process so therefore during the generation process you just kind of a sample from this limiting distribution and then you kind of iteratively apply your neural network to generating the data that you have so basically manager right we just build a diffusion model for materials in the space of this like Adam Thai position to corrupt and Hyper positions so that we reach a limiting distribution of random atom and structures and at the same time we learn a reverse model that that reverse is process so that in the sampling doing the generation process we just a sample from this random distribution of of materials so so so first I'm going to talk about how do we Design This forward the corruption process so so don't you understand the first person to understand the standard for corruption process it is important to understand that actually here we kind of a factorise this Corruption of atom time in a position into three independent corruption process for atom types of positions and the letters so it is important to note that even though the forward process we assume this Independence right between the three different attributes so the reverse model is still a joint model meaning both positions and twin the reverse Model A jointly so in the next few days I'm going to talk into a little bit more detail for each one of this corruption process so first I'm going to talk about Adam corruption where we take this method called a decision this is because I don't type is a categorical variable right so you can only take values from the elements in the periodic table so we we use this method of disappear which was specifically designed for discrete variables and at the highest level this idea so they introduce this is the amount of transition Matrix Q which basically corrupts these random variable of atom types so many different ways one could design this Mark of transition Matrix which is the most categorical diffusion process performs the best so in here this transition was basically you are kind of corrupting this atom types into a master stage with certain probability beta at each state each step so that the limiting diffusion right so everything becomes his master State and then the reverse process you can have a generating all different elements from this master stage so it is so the next let's go into talking about how do we build the diffusion corruption process for fractional coordinates so in here the most important thing is to realizing that the coordinates are living in the periodic space right so if you kind of move an atom within the unit cell moving from moving out of the box from One Direction what kind of coming back right from the other direction right so the key question is how do you actually capture this periodicity in the forwards so in here we got to inspired for this reasonable work of to my generation where they design a corruption forces for this portion of angles within the molecules so this is a value that you can take between -1 and Pi in actually have a very similar property as what we have and also has identity right if move this person no angles I was outside of a pile what kind of coming back from manage time so in this paper they showed that you can actually describe the corruption process for this periodical variables using something called a wrap the normal distribution which is basically a summation of a calculation distribution of a bunch of calcium modes that each sentence around 02 p 4pi and -25 distribution will basically be a uniform distribution with so this is a very nice as a result to be able to capture this periodicity in the forward question process so what do we do that we just take this idea but extend this from one direction to 3 Dimension basically you can you can represent the corruption of Fresno it's within a 3D wrap the normal distribution and one additional thing we actually did was that we actually rescued this virus is Sigma using the number of atoms this is because we are now building diffusion in the fractional coordinates right so therefore we hope to kind of a rescue this virus such that the corruption you add in the Cartesian space is similar no matter for bigger crystals with more atoms or smaller crystals with fear items so the last thing we introduced is this letter distribution which is basically how you can corrupt they say that without three so in here the most important thing here was that you would want to kind of so they're actually a additional equipment here which is the rotation of meaning you can apply a rotation Matrix right to this play latest Baptist you can rotate it together with the coordinates and the material actually not change so actually we want to get rid of this rotation Matrix so what do we want what we did is that we did this we use this approach called a polar decomposition where we can have a decompose this letter is about into a rotation Matrix and a symmetric Matrix and it will only perform diffusion over this Matrix and let me get into a little bit more details right for this letter diffusion so which is basically additional thing we introduced to performing and environments to make the model performance so let me explain what does that mean so if actually if you do the kind of the naive the virus preserving diffusion for the letters right so basically you are so your limiting distribution for the letters were basically be centered around 06600 this will actually did into highly skilled limiting letters so this is causing a lot of problems because if you are very very skilled in others that you're having a very strange crystal structure were causing a lot of training instability so we will perform is that we kind of adjust this mean and a virus such that so at the limit we actually approached more like a cubic lettuce and the size of a cube is also scared by the number of atoms this actually significantly improved our training stability and making our model perform much better so this is kind of an overview right about how do we kind of corrupt the crystal structure in the forward process by independently corrupt at times positions in the letters so now let me introduce how do we learn this reversible that kind of reverse this corrupt the structure back the reverse model is a equivalent of a school at work actually it is a dream that we take the gymnast architecture if you are familiar with that and this model inputs a corrupted crystal structure and outputs a three scores for Adam types positions and the letters is a numerous school for the lettuce and the coordinates this are equivalent to schools so and there's a couple of technical issues that we need to handle first is how would you handle this city and then the second right so is how to handle the equivalent score for the letters because it has already been sold into handle how to equivalent score for the coordinates in the gym that so for Henry period introduce the in the citizen work which I think many of these audience would be familiar with but let me kind of getting spend a little time to get into details here so if you want to represent a mature structure right after using graph so it is important to introduce multiple edges to represent this graph so here's an example of a material is two atoms CCM car ride so even though they are only two atoms in the periodic cell if you look at the center atoms and looking at his neighbor's they're actually ate neighbors that have the same distance and all the other neighbors are the original Adam so therefore if you repeat that in a graph you're going to need to introduce a angel label okay which basically describes how would you translate this Adam J in order to achieve this label but representation of the material so that's becoming easy to compute this X Factor d i g n k which is basically the vector between Adam and J plus this translation vector and then perform a doctor that with respect to L and then you can basically adapt this for any equivalency of the materials so not let me talk about how would you actually introduce right this equivalent to 222 explain this I think it's better to kind of establish explain how do you introduce this equipment school for coordinates in a gymnast because you can get Inspirations for that so in the equivalent of the coordinates so you can actually think about X Factor for all the neighbors of mine so basically and then this 5 is a learnable a scalar number that was kind of a dependent on the edge of another idea so basically what you're going to think about this as kind of a weighted sum of all this so that they can put another Vector which you can have a learnable like like a learnable directions and cute and this will also be equivalent which is bad to your input but actually another way to think about the same equation is that you can actually think about this term as some kind of a force that is centered around each other so therefore if the basically take you assumed kind of artificial energy you think the realities of each year coordinates and you do this kind of a factorization that you were basically getting I'm assuming this first the term is a learnable parameter then you will basically getting this equation that is exactly almost exactly the same as this equation but it kind of explain this from a more physical perspective but the advantage of the thinking about in this perspective is that then you can actually extend this also to the letters right so you can take a derivative with respect to the L which gives you this equation a very similar to the previous one but a fast this additional term of that is related to freshener coordinates so this is a kind of a this is basically give you an equivalent score to the latest but actually one additional thing we noticed is that basically if you add an additional out here now this will become an engineer thing Thomas the magic that would you end up getting is the equivalent and about signature and equivalent to school because you remember of diffusion process also symmetric right so then this is the kind of our eventual form of the latest score that we are getting so so now I have to talk to you about the phone says and the reverse process so basically in a train ticket and this is the overall picture about our manager and architecture so okay so I got into the end of this section so I'm going to because of the time I probably only going to take one question one question so I wonder maybe if somebody wants to shut up for one question we can take it now otherwise I'm going to like move over to the next OK Google hands up maybe I'm only taking one questions because of the time yeah thanks my question is is it also and this may not be the best time to ask you but it is this is it possible in this model to also account for the the production difficulty or a path to generating the the materials Elementary materials and then we have additional prediction workflows to for the future Donna Kennedys so that before this world will be sent out for experiments so that's how we calculate it for now okay so there's a lot of quick question that in the chat maybe I'm going to answer here is the number of atoms fixed doing the noisy or the noising process the answer is yes okay I'm seeing a lot of other questions which is basically how you train this morning and generating no more stable materials okay so just remind you write so translate materials in the periodic table so we hope to curate a 20-minute set that is as big as possible but also in property in his mother's day but so what do we did is that we combine these three data sets one is icsd the experimental data set which is proprietary and the final day when you incorporate this open Alexandra dataset which was one of the biggest explorations of a Nova materials that includes a round couple of media materials and then we can have a combine all these three data sets and because they all have been running project but we run a calculation and then we build a compass house and then to kind of filter the candidates so that way only taking materials that is within 09920 atoms because this is where we have the most performance the best and then this end up having a a 6775 then the the previous days that we have which is the mp20 data set including all the structures of images project within 20 hours and the basically by 20/11 with this big data sets that we were able to generate in pretty realistic materials across periodic table so in here this was just the full randomly selected materials from the model generated you can see the song and also the the song ionic materials the the 31st each one of them have reasonable coordination environments as you can see here but of course you want to have a more quantitative evaluations so which is usually a hard question for General Motors so it's been a lot of time thinking about what is the correct magic for you to evaluating a genetic model so basically in here we're going to look at the three key metrics first is the percentage of stable materials within 0.1 evapor atom and then the second is the percentage of a unique materials because you have to generate in diverse materials you don't want to generating a lot of a duplicate and last one is percentage of a novel materials because you don't want to regenerate his judges I was in a training data so that we come together and so therefore he magic is the percentage of a stable unique and no more judges abbreviated as some materials which is an interesting name that would come up with so and then we resistant magic we show that manages actually state of Art in January 14th compared with the previous video of how in here actually what you can we actually this in Tangled the name improvements of model open data so for for motorboat trainer mp20 the medicine was 1.5 times better than Siri well the other 1.8% performance Improvement coming from the the much bigger 20 data so in addition we also looking at the imsd of structures that we generate a compared with the DFT real estate so you can see again with model implements we see two times three times drop where with data information is very small for the generator the materials which is better to have to relax the structures so in addition we also hope to look at how does a model perform if you scale up the generation to a million structures so we actually found that for example the the uniqueness only jobs to 8086 percent of the whiskey into a million crystals meaning for this a million questions 86% of them they are all different and in addition the novelty status 6689 for the condition for materials so now maybe I saw it really a lot of questions from the chat so you can you maybe take one question for me and I'm going to answer the rest in the later yeah we do have nine questions in the Q&A chain there are some that are very long Reserve those the end but we can pick one short one so there's one from then O'Connor who asks do these diffusion models work for organic molecular crystals I I think nobody have tried it so far a molecule in a vacuum there's a lot of work applying diffusion models for justice for example the condition of protein Pocket Edition but so far I have not seen any work that apply this model to organic actress periodic crystals but I think it will not be difficult to extend this model to those class materials actually two more questions that are very closely related also maybe somewhat short maybe we can tackle those right now Subarus are the individual losses for each score tied together and if so how are these coupled yeah that's a good question so they are together because I said that we we just the train a single model write that outputs all these three scores so therefore they are a couple together but we actually need to kind of ways for differentiation of the materials so so far right I'd be mostly talking about unconditional generation meaning we just generating no more stable materials but I think the most important problem for material generation is really conditional generation you wanted to generate some new battery material right you don't want to generate some random materials so therefore the key questions how would you like use the model to generate team materials condition on the properties that you are interested in so we have used this approach called the classified free guidance which is basically the same approach that was used for popular text image models like Dolly 2 or stable diffusion so the key equation here is a very simple which is basically are you kind of unconditional school and a conditional school and here this summer is just the way changing the contributions from these two schools and so we already have the unconditional school but to run this conditional store what do you to do is that you basically taking data basically stable materials with the condition right could it be a property or could it be certain chemistry and then you you can sign the condition of school model using this data but actually there is some unique challenges to train a conditional model for materials compared with training text image models for 32 so the first is a materials right different conditions actually stays in different states for example for different properties they live in different places right for chemistry with properties so this is quite different from text image models where the text just leaves in the same space for the text so you can the condition of data are really spots right because it's much more expensive to generate lucky data compatible with relaxing materials charges so you usually have much fewer Property Data compared with a structured data so this is why we adopt a fine tuning as the main approach for us to obtain a condition model from the unconditional model so basically we have for each condition so basically we have this model and then we actually kind of a fine chew it for a different condition where for each condition we have this additional MLP that basically introduces an inviting layer for each one of the different conditions so basically this components for all the models and this MLP is only for each condition and here we use this control night which is the basically a song called the perimeter efficient where okay you initializing the weights and the buyers for this 0 so therefore at the beginning it doesn't alter the output but as you find you it would kind of change the output of this model based on each condition and that's how we obtain a conditional model from unconditional models so with this approach we actually find 200 companies in the model for three different kinds of conditions one is chemistry 273 and the last one is so in this time I'm going to focus on the chemistry and the property component and you can read more about the signature components in our paper so first let's talk about January materials condition chemistry so here we are going to tackle the problem that we have mentioned earlier which is a give you a new chemical system in any Dimension right by binary and the goal is to generate in the First Energy structure that was on the on the comments this is a very important problem because you wanted to kind of discover new materials in Target and chemical systems for a lot of material design problems to to evaluate the performance model we randomly selected as a 9239 for China rate at 9:29 with varying degrees of exploration very number of existing material that you discovered and then we Benchmark a model manager compatible with two very popular ways of doing this type of material Discovery what is random structure search and the second is substitution so basically we use all these three messages to generate in different number of initial candidates and then we apply to relax them and a few times for the lowest energy shot so for the top 100 structure can you put that into the DFT to see which ones are actually the most stable so this is our our results basically you can see different colors represent different methods but I'll keep result is that here if you're looking at the structures that is stable number you need here stable means below 0.1 evil atom so a model actually outperforms both random structures search and the substitution for both Turner recovery systems so however if you're looking at the the structures the number of structures that was on the final combined as how then basically substitutions still performs better slowly but that for the turnaround resistance but our mother have a key at advantage in criminal rate Five animal system which actually makes a lot of sense because now you're looking at a much bigger space right you want to play generation I'm bad at candidates and this is where the advantage of a General Motors counseling so this is a one example of one chemical systems that we show the final combined the comments out here each color represents the materials sorry where does the materials come from where the methodology was used to discover this material and you can see many I think maybe half of them are coming from our model and this are some of the churches of this all looks quite reasonable from A Material Science perspective so okay so now I mean move on to the second conditional generation which is to generate materials condition on the target phone case that you're interested in so in here this is actually what the most important part here because we want to rightly generated materials even reply cloudy conditions that you are interested in so the event basically to replace this traditional screening based Paradigm by directly generating this final candidates a condition of the properties that you are interested in so I think one key result that we get is that will show that the manager and you can you can actually generating a materials condition on a diverse range of optical conditions are including magnetic density been Gap and bulk modulus including magnetic and electric and magnetic here we find too many model with different number of training data as you can see listed here but the phone for all these properties you can see that we can buy us the generated property of genetic distribution very far away from the original original so in here the purple is our generated distribution and the the green or the other 20 so I think especially for example for magnetic density and for back muscles you can we can really kind of go into the maybe top 10 on Earth on top of one or even top 0.1% in the data distribution so this really shows the advantage of being able to explore this real property real property space space space a real property that was really hard to discover with screening business message so I'm sure you are a few structures that was generated for each one this properties and their top candidates from Walmart so you can see they all look like a reasonable in terms of structures and they all have very good properties and according to our house so find out I'm going to show what is an example where we really demonstrating that our auto performance the message so in here we are comparing with the screening based light and you can see that with increase the amount of budget right so cancel comma keeps discovering a normal materials with bulk modulus bigger than 400 GPA while the screen is Baseline can never stopped and the graduate saturates because you are graduating exhausting the number of candidates that you have in your space so yeah that's the kind of the end of the conditional generation so the final example we are high or model into a more realistic example that involves multiple options so in here the problem is to design a low Supply Chain management because as many of you know that the current permanent magnetic materials they are all requires where is Elements which is a potential supply chain risk because Touch of this elements are pretty concentrated on some countries so therefore so the objective here is to optimizing two properties we hope to increase the magnetic density and we hope to decrease this so-called hhi school which is a kind of a school for the supply chain risk for the weight of the sum of the Apaches risk of all the elements that is involved in your material so we optimize the the genetic material according to this true constraints and we have found that by optimizing these two properties we can actually buy the generator distribution towards this lower end of the hhi school and if you actually applaud the distribution of elements you can see that we are actually getting rid of this shoe elements with a higher supply chain risk compatible with other elements and what kind of a January 10th of materials as the most decomposed of iron because it's one of the lowest supply chain risk elements and this is one of the our initial demonstration of the model in a more realistic images of example but obviously this is pretty early stage there is a still a gap between the materials yet okay so that's kind of the end of the talk I'm going to do a quick summary and with some Outlook so in this talk I give you all about the manager which which is the first step towards a universal management model for getting materials I have that discussed how do we build our diffusion process for materials so we have shown that so many changes currently the state of our generator for ingot play with your wine example of a multi constraint oxidation of finding this low supply chain risk the magnetic materials so I think I think we are I think I think it's pretty clear at least the maybe to me that we are graduating this paradigm shift from screening base material Discovery to generation basic material Discovery this has already happened for for drug design right so currently generator model has been kind of used to vary widely for drug Discovery from a company's so I kind of predict this will also happen for materials maybe in the next one or two years and so we think this really opens up a opportunity for the community to discover potentially some materials that was not been discovered which commercial message because if you think about a lot of time we're looking for this materials with really rare properties maybe even properties approaching the limit that is constrained by physics for example we hope to find a room temperature superconductor I would hope to find it is super ionic conductor for the batteries so sometimes we don't even know if the room temperature should not exist because they might be above what is possible according to the physics so you're really exploring this boundary here right so with traditional screening based the message even with this like a novel mature Discovery efforts right so you're really kind of expanding this little front unconditionally because you're generation is not Guided by the property that you're interested in him so what is Germany in Naples is really enable you to guide your generation of materials with those properties so this might open up an opportunity for us to discover many breaks from materials for a broad range of properties with his Chinese models so I hope that this I hope that we can gradually see this examples in the next about 3 years and I'm super excited to potentially talking with you if you have one of those examples that I think about so thank you very much for listening I saw lots of questions in a chair so I'm going to hand this over to your house so that we can also hopefully as many of the questions today thank you wow thank you very much that was a wonderful presentation very impressive results have to say thank you I used to be a bit of a skeptic on generative models for a special for periodic crystals but I would say matter Jen has changed my thinking on this is the the conditional generation based on additional properties that was very impressive results so yeah we have three minutes left in the hour but I understand that you're free at least a little bit after this so we can go a bit over time with the questions of course everyone in the what is Sophia to drop off but if you're as curious as I am perhaps you'll stick around so we have a total of 24 questions and let's just start with with a few here at random I guess a question from temujin can this diffusion model be used to generate disordered or amorphous structures this is not not today but we are we are we activated okay another question from ready to generate novel materials at scale of 10 to 12 in the introduction slides I see the novelty level is 86 percent for 1 million materials if it's not what it could be improved that's a good question so I'm actually thinking about a joy in some kind of a screening private kind of job later to see how far is that a girl but actually it's quite expensive to generate a million tell me how can I see how does that go but I think towards your question I want to be improved I think right now I'm not satisfied with the novelty which was around the 70% I hope to make it the model a generating more noble materials but this is something we can thinking about yeah but there may be some things you can improve for example introducing sometimes in a generation process but I mean yeah this is the one thing that I'm not super satisfied yeah that's an interesting answer we have a question sort of in a similar vein I guess that follows on nicely to what you just said Gordon Peterson what do you see as the limit for the AI inverse design of materials what roadblocks need to be overcome for AI modeling to rival the property prediction power of DFT the way I think about it right so that so we actually train them all are using the competition power from from the Ft or the machine as a complimentary components for for AI and material that's kind of a so I see these two complementary so yeah that's the question I think so I would I would definitely agree with that there are definitely I think there can be multiple pillars or multiple workers in computational materials DFT is definitely one of them but let me know which is a field that so basically thinking about a screening funnel right so basically this ml force field they are kind of making it faster right but they're kind of a generator model kind of expense this initial space that that's kind of a maybe one way to think about it that's a good comment oh yeah here very relevant question from Anonymous is there a code repository we can access to try it and use my virginity is pretty deep inside the Microsoft Office for making that happen so yeah we're still exploring is right now but not in different understandable let's see what else do we have there's a question from husband I hope I said that right does the corruption process or diffusing process have any limitation in supercell size of the number of atoms of the target chemical system I think you mentioned during your talk that it works best for me for structures with 20 atoms or less but maybe elaborate on that yeah so basically if you if you use the message Crystal magic search I think you're coming maybe 70% of Automotive space so that's the wrong number all right let's see more questions about the code do we also have here's another interesting question does the model take into account valence and isotopic changes so when you say I mean I guess what it means charge right right right now it does not consider that so what is isomo what is that isotopic changes so I think he means or I mean if the structure is charged balance yeah I think an infrequent source of instability like you would think that if it's not charged balance it's it's definitely not going to be stable I think so because there's no Perfect Harmony that eternity was maybe 90% for the structures in Manchester United we get like maybe 88% so it's not a big problem for a model but a slightly worse than that much is 100 I think there's another question that was sort of already answered or their types of structures in the training data that the current matter Jen consistently does poorly when generating so you mentioned large crystals are are an issue anything else you would want to call out nothing particular I think it was like the the questions are coming in faster than we can answer them because we're still at 24 and we went through like six now what else do we have here another question maybe not that one another question from Dana O'Connor I think we had a question already what ml force field are you using are using it out of the box or with additional training but we have like our internal Trinidad was a little bit more data that's what we are currently using but not standard architecture just additional training data yeah just MP3 okay let's see we have some longer questions as well there's one from to me again what reverse process become better if trained on actual MD generated disorder or more constructions with its crystalline counterpart yeah that's an interesting question so I think you can think about this corruption process as a 9553 and actually describing process which I did not definitely not going to details today but there's a lot of like mathematical derivation that you need to get into in order to get it right for example it needs to have a stationary fix the limiting distribution so that you need to kind of be able to sample from so therefore there's kind of a lot of mathematics to getting this corruption process correct and there's basically papers around that so it is so so a short answer is that this is just is artificial and you cannot change it's not easy to kind of I don't think it makes a lot of sense between physics into it that's maybe a short answer to the question another question comes from Gabrielle who asks would you have any perspective for integrating these genitals into Active Learning schemes where you could run the structure predicted by the model into automatic workflows to validate your properties and be able to feed them back to the model as further training data yeah but actually I think about that right so for example if you wanted to see maximizing both modulus like a bunch of new materials that you run DFT calculation on them for those ones that actually buy bucket images can I feed it back into your training data and it will do that thinking about that but we have not done that yet yes okay here's one question from Marty which maybe you could refer to the paper but maybe you can give us a rough outline here in the presentation how do you precisely Define a structure as being novel with respect to the reference data what is considered novel just nuke geometry or new prototype if new prototype how do you define what is a prototype yeah that's a good question so we just used the structure within so basically true structure basically if all the atom coordinates match and item type match that's how we Define all right let's see another question from Alex who asks have any experimental validation been performed for the final generated candidates and is there any possibility to add synthesis ability condition to drop DFT stable but not synthesizable candidates exploring options to experimentally validate or standings right now and yes so currently they're two different ways right so one is basically making a 2004 Toyota it's an interesting let's see what else do we have here I guess we already covered this somewhat so Ross asks could you please expand a bit on the synthesis ability / feasibility workflows mentioned earlier yes so basically and there's quite a few other things like for example amorphous right so that was also very important thing and so yeah all right yeah more do you plan on incorporating defects to your generated structures that sounds hard thinking about that okay is that higher or lower on the priority list compared to amorphous I think honestly we just need to kind of protestant let's go further down I feel like I haven't taken a look at the news questions yet can you hear us a question from Zoran can you please explain a little bit more about matter Jen generalizing to properties that are far away from the training property distribution how does that happen yeah that's a good question so I think so as long as you have one or two examples right so then I think the model were able to generate a little bit of a surprise to see how good the models I think it looks like it looks at the structure and in the chemistry of the existing materials that was in for example say hypocrisy and that generating a lot of similar to that so that's kind of for example you combine different elements right so you see what element is there another element that is how you can combine together so there's a lot of those patterns that are models do you have some just a follow-up question for me here do you have some information about why the distribution of the generated band gaps was much wider than for the the Magnetic Moment and the bulk modulus for non-local property I guess you could argue that is so generous to and I think my intuition for this is definitely the real space it's a bit of further compatible with other parties that's at least very much agree that's true we have a question from adornus by the way stop me if you're running out of time let me know I'm not sure we're going to get to the end so I don't want to ask can the model take temperature or pressure into account when generating materials are these stable and ambient conditions or 0 Kelvin thank you that's a that's a fast answer yeah that makes sense we have a question from the reference long list of names the Crosman paper examining that works for Crystal structures the author discuss that gin and generally has poor performance in predicting the purity of crystals I was wondering why Madigan chose to use the edge to predict the loudest score how trustworthy is such a process yeah that's that's actually a good question I was involved in this paper as well so where we find out it's pretty hard addicted to the United States but first judges so why didn't you I think we we got to like we did a bit of an injury that the reasons for this part and so basically I think one thing that you introduce kind of a lot of rescuing right so intuitively if you can't even know the address right so on each Direction you can have a nose piercing so we can use that intuition and looking forward to potential Google is there any way of conditioning the Reconstruction part of the diffusion on the known chemistry when's the atoms such as Bond Tendencies likely coordinations Etc I don't fully understand the question yeah but maybe maybe to give us I think you can condition anything as long as you have a full water function that I gave you something that was so I think the short answer is yes I would guess but a very similar follow-up question from Nicholas can any arbitrary property maybe something like manufacturability that can be expressed in terms of the score model be used for conditional generation yes for example if you have like a manufacturer ability score video a list of materials and your computer each one of their manufacturing schools right that it will be looking very similar to for example condition on band gaps or conditional box modulus and then you can do it in that way so yeah in principle anything that is you can compute you can condition on there's a follow-up question about the structure from Anonymous do you use ignore species to attempt to check whether the Frameworks are similar a good question not not yet because it's super super expensive we are really weird tracking like a compared with a very big set right so I can talk about close the million materials so if you do this for like if you know what I don't touch it will be super super expensive not do that we still have over 20 Questions left but maybe we can do a couple more yes okay so there's one from Nicolai who asks do you have any ideas for diffusion on the number of atoms such that one can sample the grand canonical song that was in like in the machine learning community of Adam diffusion but it's not going to go so I think more Innovation well your your door into this field yes I think we already answered this is the question is your team working on any model for organic materials design or we answered something like that okay there we go all right now in function for diffusion model what are the benefits compared to others such as simple makes the mathematics of the diffusion process much easier so it's actually not trivial to extend this into function about the distance from work that was doing that space and simple some some work or somewhere internally going on at the moment some external work on diffusion this is like a more General diffusion models yeah okay thank you is one from Taiwan who asks when you corrupt the lattice have you considered the conservation of the atom number in other words you should know the story of the material before the process right or I guess it's time so therefore story all right so we're reaching 20 minutes past the hour here and we went through almost 30 questions so this is this is you're very heroic effort thank you very much Tien and I apologize to everyone who's question we didn't get to I realized there are a lot of questions left we will like I said upload this video to the MP YouTube channel probably by tomorrow and so feel free to continue the discussion their specially if those maybe can be answered by other people in the audience let me let me finish by extending a very very big thank you again for coming on and for presenting matter Jen to this audience I think this is a clear sign of a huge interest in the field and we're very excited to see what you'll be doing next thank you very much
